About
=====

This project provides an implementation of a client-side (implicit grant)
OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.


Features
========

* Retrieval of a user's token using popups using the promise-based
  ``Token.getTokenByPopup()`` function, that presents the user with the
  authorization endpoint and returns the token asynchronously.

  (Implementation detail: A successfully obtained access token is handed back
  to the parent window via ``window.opener.postMessage`` and the source and
  origin of the sending window are verified by the parent.)

* Access token verification using ``Token.verifyAsync``, by requesting token
  information from the authorization server, verifying that the token
  is valid and that it was generated by the current client (to prevent the
  confused deputy problem).

* Storage and retrieval of tokens via the `Token.get` and `Token.set`
  calls in the `Token` service.

* A preconfigured module for use with Google authentication.  Check out the
  `example/js/demo.js <example/js/demo.js>`_ and
  `example/demo.html <example/demo.html>`_ for an example.


Demo
====

Online
------

Check out the demo by going to `example/demo.html via rawhithub.com`_.

.. _example/demo.html via rawhithub.com: https://rawgithub.com/enginous/angular-oauth/master/example/demo.html


Local
-----

1. Run a static file server in the root directory (the one this file is in)
   on ``localhost:9000``.  Python 2.X: ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000``.

2. Navigate to http://localhost:9000/example/demo.html.


Google authentication quickstart
================================

1. Create a project in the `Google APIs Console`_.  In the "API Access" tab
   of the console, create an OAuth 2.0 client ID.  When prompted, set the
   following settings:

   * **Application Type**: Web application.

   * **Site or Hostname**: The location at which you'll host these files.


2. Edit authorized redirect URIs and JavaScript origins to match where you
   will be hosting your site.  For example, let's say you're planning to
   host your site at https://example.com/.  In that case, you might upload
   the `angular-oauth` code to https://example.com/angular-oauth/.  You would
   then set your client ID settings accordingly:

   * **Authorized Redirect URIs**:
     https://example.com/angular-oauth/oauth2callback.html

   * **Authorized JavaScript Origins**: https://example.com


3. Add ``googleOauth`` as a dependency to your app.

4. Configure the ``TokenProvider`` with the following minimal settings:

   * `clientId`: (Required.) The client ID of your application, as given
     by your authentication server.

   * `redirectUri`: (Required.) The URI to redirect back to.  You normally
     have to configure your authorization server to ensure that it redirects
     back to this point.

   * `scopes`: (Optional.) A list of scope tokens to describe the scope
     of the access request (more concretely, what information will be
     requested.)  The scopes available for a given service are probably
     documented by the authorization server.

   For example::

     config(function(TokenProvider) {
       TokenProvider.extendConfig({
         clientId: '191261111313.apps.googleusercontent.com',
         redirectUri: 'http://localhost:9000/oauth2callback.html',
         scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"]
       });
     }).

5. After doing this, you can inject the ``Token`` service and enjoy its methods:

   * Request a token with ``Token.getTokenByPopup()``, which returns a
     promise that resolves to an object with an ``access_token`` item.

   * Verify that this is a valid token for your application by calling
     ``Token.verifyAsync(accessToken)``, which returns a promise that
     resolves to the response of `Google's TokenInfo service`_.

   * If you're able to verify the token, persist it in the browser using
     ``Token.set(accessToken)``.

   * Then when you need that token (e.g., to authorize a web service call),
     call ``Token.get()``.

Roadmap
=======

This is a work in progress!  Don't use it in production.  Here's some of what's
yet to be done:

* Security.  While some mechanisms have been implemented to prevent token
  stealing, the project needs a systematic review of weaknesses.  Some things
  to look out for are outlined in the OAuth specification, which also links
  to other resources.

  I also don't have intimate knowledge of the browser security model.  The
  isolation of ``localStorage``.

* Testing.  Still lacking some confidence in this area, but soon enough
  I'll need to do something about the lack of tests.

* Customization.  Users may not always want to use popups.  Perhaps taking
  over the entire browser window is more appropriate in some cases.  (The
  reason for focusing on popup support is that tokens may expire, and ideally
  reauthentication should be able to occur without interrupting the state of
  the application.)

* Browser compatibility and fault-tolerance.

  * I've tested all of one browser (Chrome).

  * The library currently depends on ``localStorage`` and doesn't take
    alternative measures if it's not available.

  * Unexpected behaviors are not handled gracefully.  For example, if the
    user opens the callback page, they aren't presented with a friendly
    message explaining what might have happened.  Ideally, the popup would
    notify the parent when it's closed (if that's even possible when the
    site in the popup has a different origin.)

* It would be nice to support more authorization servers out of the box.
